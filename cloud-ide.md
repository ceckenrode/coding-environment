# Cloud IDE

Instead of installing the programs on our personal computers, we can use a Cloud IDE.

While there are many options, we recommend starting with Cloud9; it has much of what is needed set up already. Cloud IDEs allow us to run a full-fledged coding environment inside our web browser. The setup is quick and straightforward, which makes using a cloud IDE a no-brainer at this stage of the game.

[AWS Cloud 9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) has a free tier but requires you to sign up with AWS with a credit card (and charges you automatically if you go beyond your free tier).

Once you're signed up you'll have an in-browser editor you'll use for all of your coursework. With Cloud 9, Ruby and Rails are already set up and available in the default workspace.
